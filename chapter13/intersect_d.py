#this method is for the intersection of two list where there is a massive difference
# between the size of the two lists

#first case just brute force it where you check all the numbers in one list with
# numbers in the other

def check_intersect(A, B):
    #check the numbers in the first array with the numbers in the second array
    return [a for i, a in enumerate(A) if ()]

A = [1, 3, 4, 5]
thing = enumerate(A)
for t in thing:
    print(t)
print(thing)
